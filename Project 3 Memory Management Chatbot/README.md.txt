#Project 3: Memory Management Chatbot

## "Optimizing Memory Management in C++: A Chatbot That Answers Questions"

In this project, I combined my passion for software programming and memory management by building a chatbot that answers questions about C++ memory management. I optimized the code using modern techniques such as smart pointers and move semantics, showcasing my ability to write efficient and well-optimized code in C++.

I leveraged my knowledge of object-oriented design to write clean, maintainable, and reusable code that effectively solves the problem at hand. This project allowed me to delve into the intricacies of memory management in C++, including dynamic memory allocation, garbage collection, and memory leak prevention.

Whether you're a seasoned software developer or just starting out, this project is a great way to get hands-on experience with memory management in C++ and object-oriented design. I hope that it will inspire you to tackle similar projects and help you grow as a software developer. By working on this project, I was able to reinforce my skills in software programming and memory management, further solidifying my expertise in these areas.
