# C++ Project-Portfolio: Solving Real-World Problems through Object-Oriented Design and Concurrent Programming"

Welcome to my C++ project portfolio! Here, you will find a collection of our most impactful and challenging projects, each showcasing my expertise in solving real-world problems through object-oriented design and concurrent programming. Our projects range from route finding, process monitoring, memory management chatbots, to concurrent traffic simulation.

## Project 1: Route Finder 
Using OpenStreetMap data and the IO2D visualization library, I built a route planner that utilizes the A* search algorithm to find the optimal path between two points on a real-world map.

## Project 2: Process Monitor 
This system monitor provides a comprehensive view of what's happening on your computer, including information about processes, their IDs, CPU and memory usage, and more. My implementation, built using object-oriented design in C++, is similar to the widely-used htop application.

## Project 3: Memory Management Chatbot 
This chatbot answers questions about C++ memory management and was optimized using modern techniques such as smart pointers and move semantics.

## Project 4: Concurrent Traffic Simulation 
We designed and built a multithreaded traffic simulator that utilizes a real urban map. Each vehicle runs on a separate thread and intersections are managed to facilitate traffic flow and avoid collisions. Our implementation leverages mutexes to prevent race conditions.

I hope that these projects will demonstrate my ability to build software to tackle complex software problems and provide real-world solutions using C++.
