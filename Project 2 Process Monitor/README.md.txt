# Project 2: Process Monitor

## "Object-Oriented Design Meets System Monitoring: A Linux-Inspired Process Monitor"

In this project, I put my object-oriented design skills and software programming expertise to the test by building a system monitor that provides a comprehensive view of what's happening on a computer. This includes information about processes, their IDs, CPU and memory usage, and more.

Inspired by the popular htop application, I used C++ to create a similar system monitor, demonstrating my ability to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code. I made use of best coding practices to ensure that my implementation is scalable, maintainable, and reusable.

Through this project, I was able to gain deeper insights into system monitoring, process management, and performance optimization. I also had the opportunity to expand my knowledge of object-oriented design and software programming, further solidifying my skills in these areas.

Whether you're a seasoned software developer or just starting out, this project is a great way to get hands-on experience with system monitoring and object-oriented design in C++. I hope that it will inspire you to tackle similar projects and help you grow as a software developer.
