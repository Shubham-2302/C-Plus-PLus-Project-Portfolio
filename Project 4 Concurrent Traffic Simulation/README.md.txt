# Project 4: Concurrent Traffic Simulation

## "Managing Traffic Flow in a Multithreaded World: A Concurrent Traffic Simulator"

In this project, I designed and built a multithreaded traffic simulator that leverages a real urban map to provide an accurate representation of city traffic. Each vehicle runs on a separate thread, allowing me to simulate the movements and behaviors of individual vehicles in a highly concurrent environment.

I used mutexes to manage intersections and prevent race conditions, demonstrating my ability to write concurrent and thread-safe code in C++. This project allowed me to delve into the intricacies of multithreading and synchronization, and reinforced my understanding of these concepts.

By using object-oriented design and writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code, I was able to create a scalable, maintainable, and reusable traffic simulator that provides insights into the complexities of managing traffic flow in a multithreaded environment.

Whether you're a seasoned software developer or just starting out, this project is a great way to get hands-on experience with multithreading and synchronization in C++. I hope that it will inspire you to tackle similar projects and help you grow as a software developer. Through this project, I was able to reinforce my skills in software programming and multithreading, further solidifying my expertise in these areas.
