# Project 1: Route Finder using A* Search Algorithm

## Introduction:

####"Optimizing Paths with the A* Search Algorithm: A Real-World Map Route Planner"

Welcome to the Route Finder project! This project showcases my expertise in route planning and optimization. I utilized OpenStreetMap data and the IO2D visualization library to build a route planner that finds the optimal path between two points on a real-world map. The core of the planner is the A* search algorithm, a powerful technique for finding the shortest path between two points in a graph.

This project allowed me to delve into the intricacies of route planning, including data representation and visualization, graph traversal algorithms, and optimization. I leveraged my knowledge of C++ and object-oriented design to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code that effectively solves the problem at hand.

The final result is a powerful and visually appealing tool that can be used in a wide range of applications, from logistics and transportation to geographic information systems and beyond. Whether you are a professional software developer or just a curious student, this project is a great opportunity to expand your skills and explore the exciting world of route planning.
